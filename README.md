## 💰 Tippy: Tip Calculator

---

### Project Description

**Tippy** is a simple, user-friendly Tip Calculator application built using Python's **tkinter** library for the Graphical User Interface (GUI). This application simplifies the process of calculating a bill's tip and determining the amount each individual owes, especially when dining with a group.

It offers flexibility with two main calculation options:

1.  **Preset Tips:** Quick calculation using standard **15%** or **18%** tip percentages.
2.  **Custom Tip:** Allows the user to enter any **custom percentage** they desire.

The final results display the total tip amount, the grand total (bill + tip), and the cost **per person** based on the party size entered.
